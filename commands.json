Apply this review philosophy systematically:\n\n## Design System First\n- **Theme compatibility**: Works in light/dark AND old/new themes?\n- **Semantic tokens**: Replace hardcoded colors with `border-subtle`, `surface-glass`\n- **Visual evidence**: Request screenshots/videos if missing\n- **Design alignment**: Matches Figma specs?\n\n## Aggressive Cleanup\n- **Remove unused**: Components, imports, files, commented code\n- **Consolidate**: Similar components that could be unified\n- **File organization**: Components in right locations?\n\n## Technical Excellence\n- **React patterns**: Proper `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, TypeScript\n- **Component reuse**: Composing existing vs creating new\n- **Accessibility**: ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers\n\n## Red Flags\n- Hardcoded colors (`#fff`, `rgb()`)\n- Duplicate patterns\n- Missing visual docs\n- Poor TypeScript\n\n**Priority order**: Design system consistency → Code cleanliness → Component reusability → Technical implementation → Test coverage",

(narrow down)\n- Create minimal reproduction case\n\n## 3. Understand\n- Read the code path carefully\n- Check recent changes (git log, blame)\n- Add logging/debugging to trace execution\n- Form a hypothesis about root cause\n\n## 4. Fix\n- Address root cause, not symptoms\n- Consider edge cases your fix might affect\n- Write a test that would have caught this\n- Keep the fix minimal and focused\n\n## 5. Verify\n- Confirm fix resolves the original issue\n- Check for regressions\n- Test edge cases\n- Monitor after deploy\n\nDocument your findings for the postmortem.",
